I'm switching away from the templates github pages has in store and do my own
thing. Well not quite yet. As Angular was too much effort to maintain, I
decided to switch to [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/). It's a fast, reliable static
site generator that fits all my needs.

As you can see now, it's basically operating. Hopefully there will be some
customisation in the upcoming weeks.

Stay tuned.
