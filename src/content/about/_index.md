This is a playground for me learning stuff about static site generation with hugo. Also, there is some real informtion here.

**Music** is an essential part of me. I love to make music, to learn about music and to listen to music.

To go on **Journeys** is what forms character. If my travels turn out to be sportive, I like to trek, climb, boulder, mountainbike and to chill ;-).

**Coding** is my profession. Being a geographer, geoinformatisc turned out to pay my bills. Python, JavaScript, Markdown, HTML & CSS are my tools to do nearly everything considering geo-data.
